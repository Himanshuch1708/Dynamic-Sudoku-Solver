## Introduction
Sudoku is a popular logic-based puzzle game that involves filling a grid with numbers. The objective is to fill each row, column, and subgrid with numbers from 1 to N (where N is the size of the grid) without repeating any numbers. This repository provides a flexible and efficient solver that can handle Sudoku puzzles of different sizes.

## Features
- Supports Sudoku grids of various sizes (e.g., 4x4, 9x9, 16x16, 25x25).
- Uses a backtracking algorithm to efficiently find solutions.
- Provides a command-line interface for solving Sudoku puzzles.
- Allows users to input their own Sudoku puzzles for solving.
- Displays the solved Sudoku grid and solution steps.
