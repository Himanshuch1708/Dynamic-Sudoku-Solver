# Dynamic Sudoku Solver

I have developed a web-based tool that visually demonstrates the backtracking algorithm for solving Sudoku puzzles. This tool allows users to witness the algorithm in action, providing real-time execution and a clear understanding of how backtracking works. By using this tool, users can enhance their problem-solving skills and gain insights into the Sudoku-solving process.

## Introduction
Sudoku is a popular logic-based puzzle game that involves filling a grid with numbers. The objective is to fill each row, column, and subgrid with numbers from 1 to N (where N is the size of the grid) without repeating any numbers. This repository provides a flexible and efficient solver that can handle Sudoku puzzles of different sizes.

## Features
- Supports Sudoku grids of various sizes (e.g., 4x4, 9x9).
- Uses a backtracking algorithm to efficiently find solutions.
- Provides a command-line interface for solving Sudoku puzzles.
- Allows users to input their own Sudoku puzzles for solving.
- Displays the solved Sudoku grid and solution steps.
